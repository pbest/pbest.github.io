    "bio": "<p class='Para'>Zach Goodwin is a director at ISL Studios and ISL&rsquo;s Executive Creative Director.  He has directed commercials and content for Volkswagen, Dannon&rsquo;s Danimals Yogurt, Dramamine, Oikos Yogurt, EPT Home Pregnancy Test and 19 Crimes.</p><p class='Para'>Zach has a passion for the place where story meets the meticulously art directed. Color and just-so compositions are a hallmark of his style. He&rsquo;s usually happiest when there is a built-from-scratch set or seemingly impossible camera movement in the mix. But he’ll also move heaven and earth in pursuit of the take that lands a good joke.</p><p class='Para'>As ISL&rsquo;s ECD, he leads an eclectic, multidisciplinary creative team that crosses mediums in pursuit of powerful brand experiences. As a partner and ISL&rsquo;s founding creative, Zach has shaped the work and the voice of agency since 2008.</p><p class='Para'>In 2017, Zach introduced Tim Horton&rsquo;s new lattes to North Americans in a national campaign that spanned broadcast, OOH, Radio and Online. Campaigns that straddle the digital-and-physical world, like his work for NBC Universal&rsquo;s Mr Robot, Miller Coors&rsquo; Redd&rsquo;s Apple Ale or Volkswagen&rsquo;s #pinkbeetle have drawn attention — and a few Cannes lions along the way.</p>",
